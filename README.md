# Telecom-Customer-Churn
Background:

A leading telecommunications company is experiencing a high rate of customer churn, which is negatively impacting its revenue and market share. The company offers various services including mobile, landline, and broadband connections, as well as additional services such as data plans, roaming packages, and value-added services. The company wants to understand the underlying reasons for customer churn and develop strategies to reduce it.
Objective:
The objective of this case study is to perform a comprehensive analysis of customer churn using Tableau. The analysis aims to identify patterns, trends, and factors contributing to churn, and to provide actionable insights to the company's management for implementing targeted retention strategies.
Data Collection:
The company has collected a dataset containing historical customer data, including demographic information, usage patterns, service subscriptions, billing details, and churn status. The dataset spans a period of several years and includes information about both churned and retained customers.
Analysis Steps:
1. Data Exploration and Preparation:
Load the dataset into Tableau and performed data profiling to understand its structure and contents.
Cleansed the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent entries.
Created calculated fields to derive important metrics such as customer tenure, total spending, usage intensity, etc.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualized the overall churn rate over time to identify any seasonal trends or fluctuations.
Analyzed the distribution of churned customers based on demographics (age, gender, location) to identify potential patterns.
Compared the service subscriptions and usage patterns of churned and retained customers to identify any significant differences.
3. Customer Segmentation:
Employed clustering techniques to segment customers based on their behavior, usage, and spending patterns.
Created visualizations to showcase these segments and identify which segments have the highest churn rates.
4. Customer Journey Analysis:
Created a visual representation of the typical customer journey from onboarding to churn.
Identified key touchpoints or stages where customers are most likely to churn.
5. Interactive Dashboards:
Developed interactive dashboards to provide an overview of the churn situation, allowing stakeholders to explore data on their own.
6. Recommendations:
Based on the insights gathered, provided actionable recommendations to the company to reduce churn.
Suggested personalized retention strategies for different customer segments.
7. Monitoring and Reporting:
Setting up a mechanism to continuously monitor churn rates and the effectiveness of implemented strategies.
Generated periodic reports and visualizations to track progress and make data-driven decisions.
Outcome:
Through this Tableau-based analysis, the telecommunications company gains a deeper understanding of customer churn patterns and the underlying factors driving churn. The actionable insights derived from the analysis help the company implement targeted strategies to reduce churn and improve customer retention, ultimately leading to increased revenue and market share
